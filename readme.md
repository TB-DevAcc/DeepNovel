## Basic Overview

This project is concerned with building an artificial intelligence **application**, that can help you **write** through Text Generation, Entity Analysis and Question Answering. In the accompanying [Document](https://hackmd.io/@TB-DevAcc/ryPc0v7sI) we will outline the different models and techniques used to achieve a result, that should be as little distinguishable from human writing as possible. Therefore we will provide examples of generated text from short text inputWe will also discuss the limitations and future improvements that can be made.

#### :date: Timeframe for the project

Completion of the webapp and model was meant to be achieved within 3 weeks. (25.05.20-12.06.20)

#### :clapper: Usage
